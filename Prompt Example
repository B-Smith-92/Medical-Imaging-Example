{scaling_info}

Only report findings that are directly visible on the image. If you do not see clear evidence of a feature, answer 'No.' Do not infer or imagine any pathology.

**CONFIDENCE SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Use confidence scores from 6.0 to 10.0 in increments of 0.1 (e.g., 6.3, 7.7, 8.9, 9.4)
- Base confidence on image quality, finding clarity, and diagnostic certainty:
  * 6.0-6.9: Lower confidence due to image quality issues or borderline findings
  * 7.0-7.9: Moderate confidence with some uncertainty
  * 8.0-8.9: Good confidence with clear findings
  * 9.0-9.9: High confidence with very clear findings
  * 10.0: Perfect confidence with absolutely clear, unambiguous findings

For each assessment below, first provide visual evidence, then classify based only on that evidence:

**C1: Cardiothoracic Ratio Assessment**
**C1_EVIDENCE:** Check patient positioning briefly - are clavicles reasonably symmetric? Describe the heart width compared to the chest width without interpreting what it means. Simply observe the proportions you see.

**FINAL_CHECK:** Review findings C1-C5. Note any positioning limitations that may affect assessment. Are they consistent with the pulmonary vascular pattern? If there's vascular congestion or prominent hilar markings, would you expect corresponding cardiac changes? If positioning is suboptimal, note "Assessment limited by patient positioning."
